- check if ATI fixed fglrx/OQ bug in next version

- make people that do teamkills/damage wait longer?

- fog entities (R, G, B, radius, fog dist),
     If player inside of radius, changes global fog color and distance to the entity's, interpolated
     with the outside map fog color depending on distance from center. Use some sort of weighted average
     if inside multiple fog entities.

- make sure all bumpmaps are parallax -> finetune each one individually

- audio effect for chat messages | audio for gui events

- social cheating solution

- before a release: update static wiki

- improve smoothness of going up steps ?
- remove delay before doors start opening ?
- make nearby closed doors render early so that they can contribute to OC?
- water physics close to surface
- add entity looping command?

- LOD: improved lod-remip?
- "editing not in view" sometimes obstructs editing
- simultaneous heightmap orientations (all six sides at same time for easier rock/cliff/caves/destructable geom?)
- multiple cube selections for heightmaps? maybe instead of selections+mode, use textures+Q?
- heightmap outlines (like sky) instead of selection box
- context sensitive editing menu: short cuts to ents, lighting, map ops etc. bind to tab. (current menu being more detailed and reference)
- combine mingw and linux makefiles?
- need to make selecting cubes/ents while inside a cube easier.... maybe modify raycube/rayent to treat cubes as 'hollow'?
- entundo more efficeint

- maybe add a way to purge infrequent / not recently used textures? esp now with mapshots.

- reduce maps
- memory leaks?
- Mix_LoadMUS() crashes after being called many times?

- death needs to be more obvious (better sound/centerprint) 
- sparklies very bad on ATI, particularly deathtek / diff skybox
- crashes when people join?
- 2 levels of lightlod for huge maps
- shallow water splashing sound?

- use setbb also for monsters
- experiment with averaging lightvector based on intensity^N, such that dominant light becomes more dominant without losing smooth transitions | store intensity multiplier in alpha?

- the eyecandy priority list: better bloom, motion blur, volumetric fog (see fog entities idea above), character bumpmaps (likely need skeletal animation to make this memory efficient)...
- bots (level design placed waypoints?)
- destructable geom

- better doc on the scripting language | beginners guide | wiki?
- fake rigid-body sphere only?
- $ vs @? var stacks? [] for trees/arrays? other improvements? | do "." for concatword so you could do easy (associative) arrays and tree structures?
- start moving some stuff in their own headers
- new BAS sounds? | player spawn | sp respawn | menu clicks | specific door sound? | end of level | push button/trigger
- improve bloom? optimize it.
- report to ATI: float vs short issue
- more cube map ports?
- integrate fmodex (to get both panning and stereo ogg on windows?)
- 3d sprites?
- monster spawner ammo - add egg model
- iconic stats
- profile for memory usage (devpartner?) | if md2 buffers are a lot, can remove it
- glowmaps in the texture browser -> messy

- make start of flares etc spawn out further from the player
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- new sounds: impact (diff materials + flesh) | flyby, both instant & projectile 

- all cfg stuff in menu
- draw not-spawned items in wireframe?

- make wether you are hitting other player clearer - blip sounds like q3?
- LOD: visibleface(lodcube==true) must not go across VA boundaries... otherwise minor HOM bewteen LOD/non-LOD rendering boundaries
- LOD: materials & sky currently always rendered at lod0 only, is that ever a problem visually/performance?
- LOD: make loddistance fov dependent (for models too)
- a multiplayer player still shows SG rays go thru target | hard to fix, is it really a problem?
- sound samples for N kills in a row
- sword?
- think about doing other permanent powerups besides +10h
- slowmo as gameplay feature?
- calclight while playing?
- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- fix variance in framerate?
- render entities at distance as sprites
- blend screen when inside a cube
