/*!
    The expression construct is the core execution construct of the scripting
    language, an expression represents an apply operation to be performed on a
    symbol object, the meaning of apply is dependant on the symbol object's
    type. A CubeScript programmer writes a script from a sequence of
    expressions; no distinction is made between statements and expressions,
    the engine treats all expressions as one type of thing: an apply operation.
    Apply operations are abstract to the expression evaluator, only the script
    writer knows what apply operation is performed, by the symbol name given.

    An expression consists of elements separated by whitespace
    characters, with the first element being the symbol name and the remaining
    elements being the arguments. An expression is terminated by a newline or
    semicolon character. An element can be a word, string, block or expression.
    When the element constructs have been evaluated, from left to right, the
    apply method will be called on the symbol object. The result value of the
    apply operation is the result of the expression.

    There is an exception to the rule of expected syntax: the expression
    construct can also detect and accept an alias assignment using infix
    notation (i.e. "name = [value]"), for convenient use.
